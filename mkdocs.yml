site_name: "OSM Imports' preparations"
site_description: "This is a proof of concept and a pet project for learning python while preparing data for importing it to OpenStreetMap. Although I will start small (importing trees from Barcelona city council), I aim to set the foundations for adding other types of imports that may (or may not) be added in the future."
